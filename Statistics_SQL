1. Calculating statictics for numerical columns
SELECT 
COUNT(*) AS total_films, 
AVG(release_year) AS average_release_year, 
MIN(release_year) AS minimum_release_year, 
MAX(release_year) AS maximum_release_year, 
AVG(rental_duration) AS average_rental_duration,  
MIN(rental_duration) AS min_rental_duration,  
MAX(rental_duration) AS max_rental_duration,  
AVG(rental_rate) AS average_rental_rate,  
MIN(rental_rate) AS min_rental_rate,  
MAX(rental_rate) AS max_rental_rate,  
AVG(length) AS average_length,  
MIN(length) AS min_length,  
MAX(length) AS max_length,  
AVG(replacement_cost) AS average_replacement_cost,  
MIN(replacement_cost) AS min_replacement_cost,  
MAX(replacement_cost) AS max_replacement_cost  
FROM film;  

2. Calculating statistics for non-numerical columns
SELECT  
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY title) AS modal_title,  
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY description) AS modal_description,  
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS modal_rating,  
MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY special_features) AS 
modal_special_features  
FROM film;
